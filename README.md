## Analysis
-  Age Group Purchasing Power: Customers aged 18-35 are the highest spenders, with the largest sales contribution coming from Clothing items, suggesting this age group is highly engaged with fashion-related purchases.
-  Gender Preferences: Female customers show a preference for purchasing Clothing than male. Female also prefer Food & Beverages over books as compared to male.
-  Popular Payment Methods: Cash is the most commonly used payment method across all transactions, but an interesting trend is that female customers tend to use credit cards more frequently than males, who predominantly use cash.
-  Peak Sales Periods: The first quarter of the year, especially January, sees the highest sales, while a notable dip in sales occurs April of the year.
-  Shopping Mall Analysis: Mall of Istanbul and Mall of Kanyon emerged as the top malls, each generating approximately 14M in sales, indicating these malls are performing exceptionally well compared to others

  ## Conlusion & Recommendations
  Based on the insights derived from the analysis, the following recommendations can be made:
- Target the 18-35 Age Group for Promotions: Since this group contributes significantly to sales, especially in Clothing items, targeted promotions or discounts during peak periods (like the start of the year) could help boost sales further.
- Gender-Specific Marketing Campaigns: Tailor marketing efforts to gender preferences by promoting Clothing items and Food & Beverages to female customers, while also considering the purchasing trends of male customers in other categories.
- Payment Method Incentives: Since cash payments dominate transactions, consider offering incentives for card payments, especially for females who are more likely to use credit cards. This could include offering small discounts or loyalty points for credit card transactions.
- Maximize Sales in Peak Periods: With the first quarter (especially January) being the peak sales period, focus on launching seasonal campaigns or special offers during this time to capture the heightened consumer activity.
- Leverage Top-Performing Malls: Since Mall of Istanbul and Mall of Kanyon are performing well, consider launching exclusive events or promotions at these malls to capitalize on their strong customer base. Explore strategies to replicate this success in other malls with lower sales performance.

By following these recommendations, business can optimize their strategies to enhance sales performance, engage with customers more effectively, and drive sustained growth in the competitive retail space.
